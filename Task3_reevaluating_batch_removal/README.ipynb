    "# PMLR report - Task 3 - Extend evaluation of batch effect removal\n",
    "Author: Pia Rautenstrauch\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 2022-02-10\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim: more comprehensive evaluation of batch effect removal exploiting nested batch effects of our benchmark dataset\n",
    "To this end we compute:\n",
    "- (graph) iLISI with covariates sample and site\n",
    "- batchASW with covariates sample and site\n",
    "\n",
    "- for all submissions scoring better than the LMDS-based baseline: see notebook: ```Compute_novel_batch_removal_metrics_for_Multiome_top_submission_per_team.ipynb```\n",
    "- for the baselines: see notebook: ```Compute_novel_batch_removal_metrics_for_Multiome_baselines.ipynb```\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine these novel with previous results in notebook ```PMLR_report_Figure3cde.ipynb```, that also holds the code that was used to generates Figure 3c-e and Figure S X from the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General\n",
    "Basis for this analysis are the embeddings generated by the best performing submission/model of each team across all subtask of Task 3 (Multiome data). Meta information can be found in the file: ```JE_multiome_output_per_tam.csv```.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some methods the run that was scored in the challenge was irreparably lost, and hence the submissions were rerun to be able to carry out this analysis. Note that this can lead to slight differences in the performance of the respective submissions due to the stochastic nature of componenents used by the participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get data\n",
    "If available I use embedding used for method ranking in the challenge, if not available an embedding obtained by a rerun of the submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution/cell type metadata\n",
